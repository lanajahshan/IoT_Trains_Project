# Project Description:
Trains are one of the most used public transports in the world, however one of the problems that comes with this, is the delays in trains arrival and the long waiting time on the platforms. 
So we have created Train Project that aims to solve this problem by letting passengers know where to stand on the platform while waiting for the train to arrive, so they can get on the train in the quickest way possible, which decreases the delay.  
We install Infrared proximity sensors above each seat in the train to indicate whether itâ€™s occupied or empty. The data is collected and stored in Firebase Realtime database and then presented on screens in the station in the following way:
Next to the entrance we place this screen that lets the passengers know the general state of the train, by showing the number of empty seats in each compartment. The shades of the colors indicate the capacity of the compartment. Where Darker blue means more empty seats.
Along the platform, next to each compartment door, we show the state of this compartment. We present the number of empty seats and the state of each seat in the compartment.
